# Top 50 Fast-Food Chains in USA

The dashboard is about top 50 fast food chains in USA. In this case specifically, the dataset don't have a lot of columns, I wanted create something with a short information.
For me is very important improve my skills, so I know I need create more visualizations and more difficult.

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/top-50-fastfood-chains-in-usa

I create 5 visualizations like:

- scatter plot: You can see the sales in millions dollars vs franchised stores
- bar plot: franchised stores vs companys stores
- bar plot: top 10 companys more sales in millions dollars
- bar plot: top 10 companys stores and franchised stores
- donut plot: top 3 sales avg per unit
