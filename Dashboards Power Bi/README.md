# First Dashboard: Company employees

This is my first dashboard in power bi. The dashboard it's about the information employees people in that company.
You can see in the dashboards:

## All the dashboards:

- One filter for job role (the filter it affects all the visualizations and the other dashboards)
- Buttons (for change the dashboard to the next one)
- Tittle

## First dashboard: rates

- Kpis (information like: daily rate, monthly rate, hourly rate, monthly income)
- Bar chart horizontal (job by gender, in this case I asked me: if the gender important enough about the job role)
- Bar chart vertical (Is interesting if the people with more studys gain more money than the people don't have it)
- Donut chart (The monthly rate it's very influency. In this case I want to see what is the top 3 jobs generate more money per month)
- Table (I created this table for answer the next question: What is the job generate more money in average per hour?)

## Second dashboard: attrition

- Kpis (about the information like: number of employees, employees didn't stay in the company, employees stay in the company)
- Scatter plot (Is very interisting see if the people with more satisfaction about the job, gain more money, the question for answer that, is: the money generate more satisfaction?)
- Pie plot (I want to see in this case which is the department with more people leave the job for any reason)
- Bar plot horizontal (Is important see the people stay in the company by role)
